FSU and UNAM Medical Imaging Repository
=========

This repository contains a set of medical imaging algorithms
developed to solve state of the art problems in cancer early detection.  
The code is mostly developed in Matlab. 

The folders are organized in the following way:

[Paths](#paths)

[Image Processing](#image processing)

[External libs](#external libs)

[Image Registration](#registration)

[Image Segmentation/Classification](#segmentation)

## Paths
Includes Matlab files used to set the paths to access the databases
being used by our group in their local machines. This folder should only
contain examples of the paths and not hardcoded paths to a specific machine. 

## Image Processsing
This folder contains examples of image processing algorithms that may be usefull
in many different scenarios. The code in this folder is general enough to easily use in multiple problems.  

## External Libs
Common libraries that are used in several projects. If the external libraries are already available in
GitHub, then they should be added as git modules. 

## Registration
Image registration algorithms for different problems like DCE-MRI, fMRI, etc. 

## Segmentation 
Image segmentation algorithms for different problems like DCE-MRI, fMRI, etc.
